# neo4jshell
Efficient querying and server management for Neo4J in R using bolt and cypher-shell.  Requires cypher-shell to be available for querying.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("keithmcnulty/neo4jshell")
```

## Functionality

### Query

- `neo4j_query()` sends queries to the specified Neo4J graph database and, where appropriate, retrieves the results in a dataframe.

In this example, the movies dataset has been started locally in the Neo4J browser, with a user created that has the credentials indicated.   cypher-shell is in the local system path. 
```
# set credentials (no port required in bolt address)
neo_movies <- list(address = "bolt://localhost", uid = "neo4juser", pwd = "neo4juser")

# find directors of movies with Kevin Bacon as actor
CQL <- 'MATCH (p1:Person {name: "Kevin Bacon"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p2:Person)
RETURN p2.name, m.title'

# run query
neo4jshell::neo4j_query(con = neo_movies, qry = CQL)



     p2.name         m.title
1 Ron Howard     Frost/Nixon
2 Rob Reiner  A Few Good Men
3 Ron Howard       Apollo 13

```

### Server management

- `neo4j_import()` imports a csv, zip or tar.gz file from a local source into the specified Neo4J import directory, uncompresses compressed files and removes the original compressed file as clean up.
- `neo4j_rmfiles()` removes specified files from specified Neo4J import directory
- `neo4j_rmdir()` removes entire specified subdirectories from specified Neo4J import directory

### Remote development

In this general example, we can see how these functions can be used for smooth ETL to a remote Neo4J server.  

```
# credentials (note no port required in server address)
neo_server <- list(address = "bolt://neo.server.address", uid = "neo4j", pwd = "password")

# csv data file to be loaded onto Neo4J server (path relative to current working directory)
datafile <- "data.csv"

# CQL query to write data from datafile to Neo4J
loadcsv_CQL <- "LOAD CSV FROM 'file:///data.csv' etc etc"

# path to import directory on remote Neo4J server (should be relative to neo4j user home directory on remote server)
impdir <- "./import"

# import data
neo4jshell::neo4j_import(con = neo_server, source = datafile, import_dir = impdir)

# write data to Neo4J (assumes cypher-shell is in system PATH variable)
neo4jshell:neo4j_query(con = neo_server, qry = loadcsv_CQL)

# remove data file as clean-up
neo4jshell::neo4j_rmfiles(con = neo_server, files = datafile, import_dir = impdir)


```

### Local Development

If you are working with the `neo4j` server locally, below will help you get started.  

First, the code below is relative to user and is using neo4j 3.5.8 community installed at my user's root.

```
## graph setup
graph = list(address = "bolt://localhost:7687", uid = "neo4j", pwd = "password")
SHELL_LOC = path.expand("~/neo4j-community-3.5.8/bin/cypher-shell")
IMPORT_LOC = path.expand("~/neo4j-community-3.5.8/import/")
```

- `graph` = the connection information
- `SHELL_LOC` = the full path to the `cypher-shell` ulility.  
- `IMPORT_LOC` = for the same server, the `import` directory, fully specified

Below, we will create a simple datafame and save that dataset to a csv file.

```
df = data.frame(id = 1:10, 
                b = letters[1:10], 
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
write.csv(df, "test-df.csv")
```

This package supports a number of delivery formats, but for simplicity sake, a `csv` file is created above.

Below, we will confirm the location of the file in our __current__ working directory, and then use `neo4j_import` to place a **copy** of this file within the import directory you defined in `IMPORT_LOC` above.  

```
# test that the file was saved to the current working directory
# list.files(pattern = "test")
# [1] "test-df.csv"
neo4j_import(local = TRUE, graph, source="test-df.csv", import_dir = IMPORT_LOC)
```

Now, let's remove that file from the import directory of our local server

```
## remove the file
neo4j_rmfiles(local = TRUE, graph, files="test-df.csv", import_dir = IMPORT_LOC)
```

Lastly, if you want to use a subdiretory to help manage your files during an ETL into `neo4j`, you can remove that local subdirectory when your process has completed.

Below walks through the steps to confirm this feature.

```
## create a test subdirectory
fs::dir_create(paste0(IMPORT_LOC, "test-dr"))

## what exists?
fs::dir_ls(IMPORT_LOC)

## remove the directory
neo4j_rmdir(local = TRUE, graph, dir = "test-dr", import_dir = IMPORT_LOC)

## confirm
fs::dir_ls(IMPORT_LOC)
```

### Local server administration and control

- `neo4j_start()` starts a local Neo4J instance
- `neo4j_stop()` stops a local Neo4J instance
- `neo4j_restart()` restarts a local Neo4J instance
- `neo4j_status()` returns the status of a local Neo4J instance
- `neo4j_wipe()` wipes an entire graph from a local Neo4J instance


For Example:

```
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# load the package
library(neo4jshell)

# setup relative to your server - for me, this is local
graph = list(address = "bolt://localhost:7687", uid = "neo4j", pwd = "password")
SHELL_LOC = path.expand("~/neo4j-community-3.5.8/bin/cypher-shell")
IMPORT_LOC = path.expand("~/neo4j-community-3.5.8/import/")
SERVER_LOC = path.expand("~/neo4j-community-3.5.8/bin/neo4j")
DB_LOC = path.expand("~/neo4j-community-3.5.8/data/")

# my server was already running, confirm
neo4j_status(neo4j_path = SERVER_LOC)

# stop the server
neo4j_stop(SERVER_LOC)

# restart to confirm that flow
neo4j_start(SERVER_LOC)

# I had a test node, that was returned
neo4j_query(graph, qry="MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as total", shell_path = SHELL_LOC)

# stop the server and wipe the database
# useful for rapid protoyping
neo4j_stop(SERVER_LOC)
neo4j_wipe(graph = "graph.db", data_path = DB_LOC)

# fire up the server
neo4j_start(SERVER_LOC)

# confirm that there are no data - a clean database server!
neo4j_query(graph, qry="MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as total", shell_path = SHELL_LOC)
```
