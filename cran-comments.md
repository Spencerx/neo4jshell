Addressed feedback from last submission on 2020-05-15:

1. Shortened Title
2. Added undirected quotes for software names in Title and Description.
3. Fixed incorrect capitalization in description text.
4. Added examples to the Rd files.  Examples that cannot be tested due to external software dependencies have been enclosed in `\dontrun{}`
